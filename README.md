## Operating Instructions
### Server
Run the server first with the port number as the only input. <br />
java -jar Server.jar 4444
### Client
After a server is up and running you can run the client with the IP and port <br />
java -jar Client.jar 127.0.0.1 4444

## Content of Repo
I have included the jar files and some documents showing the process flow for the Server and the Client. This was originally completed in a different Repo so the commit history will be very short. Each applications source code is in their respective folders.
